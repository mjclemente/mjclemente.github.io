I was very fortunate to attend my second [Adobe ColdFusion Summit](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/) this year. Prep for speaking at the conference is one of the reasons I haven't been able to blog recently -  I presented an updated version of a previous talk: *send.Better() - Giving Email a REST* ([slides here](https://slides.com/mjclemente/sendbetter-cfsummit-2018)).

This won't be a full conference review; just a few quick thoughts. As I wrote [last year](/2017/11/17/cfsummit-2017.html), Adobe runs an excellent conference. It's a great experience to hang out and learn with a large number of fellow CFML developers. There's a real sense of camaraderie, particularly during breaks, meals, and the social events. It's always great to reconnect in person, even briefly, with really talented programmers who I usually only encounter on Github, Twitter, and Slack.

If you're a CF developer with the opportunity to attend ColdFusion Summit, I recommend it. Each ColdFusion conference has it's own "flavor", and the combination of learning, networking, and community at CF Summit is worth the (very reasonable) price of admission.

Thank you again to Adobe and the ColdFusion team for putting this together. Looking forward to next year!
