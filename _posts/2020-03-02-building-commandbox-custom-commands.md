I posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGfA9SMbqDU), walking through the process of building your first CommandBox Custom Command. If you're not familiar with this aspect of CommandBox, I think you may be surprised how quickly you can build your own CLI commands.

CommandBox enables developers to extend its functionality via [CommandBox modules](https://forgebox.io/type/commandbox-modules). These serve a range of purposes - modules are used to interact with the server lifecycle, scaffold projects, and enhance the CLI. [Custom Commands](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/developing-for-commandbox/commands) are a type of CommandBox module that provide a framework and conventions for writing CLI commands in ColdFusion.

This video is quick guide to getting started with Custom Commands, but if you're looking for something more in-depth, I encourage you to [read the docs](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/developing-for-commandbox/commands), which I found to be clear, well-organized, and comprehensive.
